## About Me
Hello, I am Jared Beltran. Other than being a student at SUNY New Paltz, I am a photographer, a part time retail associate, a dog lover, and a thrill seeker who loves to adventure and try or learn new things. I am also a gamer, and my current favorite games right now are Cyberpunk 2077 and Counter Strike 2. My favorite food is Korean barbecue, and I am also a big fan of boba tea.
	
My computer experience includes being a computer science major here at SUNY New Paltz. My current interest in this field is more towards Cybersecurity and Systems Administration. Along with the major requirements, I have taken the Cybersecurity course at SUNY New Paltz during Spring 2024, and it is one of my favorite classes that I have taken here. As for personal projects, this past Summer, I collaborated with my brother who works as a Network Administrator, and we setup a home lab computer system. This system allows us to do our own server hosting on projects we would want to do. Ultimately for me, it helped me learn about resource allocation, server management, virtualization, and remote access control. Currently, I am also working towards getting CompTIA Network+ certified and laying the foundation for myself in working in an IT career.
	
I see myself using the concepts of this course in a job setting first and foremost. These concepts will help me understand how to approach building and deploying web applications, which will prove to be useful in a computer science work environment. However, I also see myself using these concepts in creating my own personal photography website, where it will double as an online portfolio as well as a means for people to book photoshoots.
